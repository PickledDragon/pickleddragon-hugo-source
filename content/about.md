Hello There! My name is Praveen Kottarathil; I am an IT Professional based in The Netherlands. I have been working in various parts of the IT Ecosystem, since my first job as a Software Developer and Trainer back in in 2004 and never looked back. 

I currently work with [ING](https://www.ing.com/), on various back-end systems that enable self-service and assisted banking services in 🇳🇱[Netherlands](https://ing.nl) & [🇧🇪Belgium](https://ing.be). Formerly I was an engineer and subject matter expert at ✈️[Emirates](https://www.emirates.com) where I used to build and operate back-office planning & (mathematical)optimization systems for Emirates Network Control & Operations.

I am [@praveenkp](https://twitter.com/praveenkp) on Twitter, [@shelldragon](https://stackoverflow.com/users/553385/shelldragon) on StackOverflow and [@PickledDragon](https://github.com/PickledDragon) on GitHub. My email is basically my first name at last name, followed by the net top-level domain.
