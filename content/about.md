Hello There! My name is Praveen Kottarathil; I am a Software Developer based in the Netherlands. I have been working in various parts of the IT Ecosystem, since my first job as a Software Developer and Trainer back in in 2004 and never looked back. This site is an ongoing work-in-progress. Expect to see more contents here soon.
